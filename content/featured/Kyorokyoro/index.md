Suspicious Head movement detection using head pose estimation. For the head pose estimation DMHead [Dual model head pose estimation. Fusion of SOTA models. 360Â° 6D HeadPose detection. All pre-processing and post-processing are fused together, allowing end-to-end processing in a single inference.] was used.
